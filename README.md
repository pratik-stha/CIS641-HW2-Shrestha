## Pratik Shrestha

* My interest area includes Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, Image Processing and Computer Vision and Signal Processing.
* I have two conference papers. One was related to Image processing where I did the extraction process and analyzed the various retinal components of human eye like size of optical disc using morphological operations. The other paper was published in IEEE and it was mainly about the wireless communication between a FPGA and a microncontroller.
* I really like doing researches and experiments, especially trying to merge the various fields. I have worked on Machine Learning but never got a chance to apply the knowledge in the field of Embedded systems. I wish try it on Raspberry Pi.

### Technical Background
My background is Electrical Engineering but I am more interested in the projects related to programming rather than core electrical stuffs like PCBs and all. I like Software programming too. I have programming experience on various languages like C#, C, C++, JavaScript and Python. Also little bit on Asp.Net. Projects related to hardware and software are my dream projects where I can work on Firmware as well as software.
