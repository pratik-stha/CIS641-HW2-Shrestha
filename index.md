## Welcome to GitHub Page of Pratik
# Introduction
<br>My background is Electrical Engineering but I am more interested in the projects related to programming rather than core electrical stuffs like PCBs and all. I like Software programming too. I have programming experience on various languages like C#, C, C++, JavaScript and Python. Also little bit on Asp. Net. Projects related to hardware and software are my dream projects where I can work on firmware as well as software.

# Research Interest

* My interest area includes Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, Image Processing and Computer Vision and Signal Processing.
* I have two conference papers. One was related to Image processing where I did the extraction process and analyzed the various retinal components of human eye like size of optical disc using morphological operations. The other paper was published in IEEE and it was mainly about the wireless communication between a FPGA and a microncontroller.
* For my master's project I am working to Hardware-Accelerate a Python function using HLS (High Level Synthesis). For this project I have chosen partition problem and for hardware platform I am using PYNQ board by Xilinx.  

# Term Project
<br>My term project for this class is <b>Calculator</b>. It is a group project and Vivi Hoang is my team mate for this project. 
The project is a simple Calculator application created in Python. Tkinter is used for Graphical User Interface. Regarding the features, our project consists of several features like Unit Conversion and Trigonomotric functions. In unit conversion, we have implemented Meter To Feet and vice versa conversion for now. We plan to expand the units in soon future. Similarly, in the Trignometric functions, we have implemented the function for only Sine at the moment. We plan to expand the functions like Cosine and Tan in soon future. 

<br>The Calculator project is a software application project. So it is very essential that we have very good planning. For the project, we have decided to follow the Prototype model. In this model, we plan, analysis, design and test the first version of the application and then iterate it througout the same process and increment the feature. For the time management and work breakdown, we have used Gantt Chart as our tool. We keep track of our work and always try our best to achieve the milestone we have set in our timeline. 

<br>As a group project, both of us are assigned with our own tasks. Vivi, my project mate, keeps tracks of our goals, requirements and timeline. She also does all the necessary testing and validation and informs me where we lack and what corrections are to be done. Similarly, my responsibility includes User Interface, logic design, class design, debugging and documentation.
